I can't remember how many times I wanted to write something substantial and put
it on the interwebz, but then decide I'll do it until I make my own website.
Well, there are no more excuses now, everything is (mostly) ready for me to
start writing, and this post will serve as a reminder of that fact.

One big irony here is that I used to work as a web developer. I can't even count
how many websites I've created or worked on, yet it took me so long to create
something just for myself.

I guess that there's some truth to that old saying:
